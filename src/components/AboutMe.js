            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Originally from the Bay Area, but I have been located in Washington D.C. since July 2019. I've been
                working in education for the last 6 years, and am currently employed as a Kindergarten STEM teacher.
                I'm looking to take my career in a new direction as I work my way through a coding bootcamp via
                Georgia Tech. I am a highly driven individual who strives to support my team by being collaborative
                and accountable. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
